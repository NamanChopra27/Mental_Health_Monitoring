# Mental Health Monitoring System  

This project is a comprehensive mental health monitoring solution that integrates multiple features to assess and monitor an individual's mental well-being. It leverages advanced technologies in machine learning, computer vision, and sensor-based data processing to provide accurate insights into mental health conditions.

## Features  

### 1. **Contactless Respiration Monitoring**  
   - **Description**: Monitors the user's respiration rate without physical contact using camera-based detection and computer vision algorithms.  
   - **Technology Used**: 
     - OpenCV for video processing.  
     - Machine learning model to calculate respiration rates from micro-movements detected in the video frames.  

### 2. **Body Temperature Detection**  
   - **Description**: Measures body temperature using an infrared sensor or thermal imaging technology.  
   - **Technology Used**:  
     - Thermal camera integration for temperature data collection.  
     - Python libraries for hardware interfacing and data visualization.  

### 3. **Depression Assessment via Questionnaire**  
   - **Description**: Provides a self-assessment questionnaire based on clinically validated scales (e.g., PHQ-9) to evaluate the user’s risk of depression.  
   - **Functionality**:  
     - User answers a series of questions about their mood, energy levels, and mental state.  
     - The system calculates a depression score and provides recommendations based on the result.  

### 4. **Facial Expression Detection**  
   - **Description**: Analyzes facial expressions to detect signs of stress, anxiety, or depression using computer vision and emotion recognition models.  
   - **Technology Used**:  
     - Pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., OpenFace, Dlib, or custom CNNs).  
     - Integration with live video or image inputs to detect and classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear.

## System Architecture  

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Video and image data for facial expressions and respiration monitoring.  
   - Sensor data for body temperature detection.  
   - User input for questionnaire-based assessment.  

2. **Processing**:  
   - Preprocessing and cleaning of video, image, and sensor data.  
   - Deployment of machine learning models for inference.  

3. **Output & Insights**:  
   - Real-time monitoring of respiration and temperature.  
   - Emotion classification results displayed as a visual graph.  
   - Questionnaire-based mental health score and recommendations.

Connecting MLX Sensors
MLX sensors, like the MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor, are commonly used for non-contact temperature measurement. They are highly accurate, easy to interface with microcontrollers or single-board computers, and suitable for applications like body temperature detection in your mental health monitoring system.

Step 1: Hardware Requirements
Sensor: MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor.
Microcontroller/Board: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or ESP32.
Wiring Accessories: Breadboard, jumper wires, pull-up resistors (if required).
Power Supply: Usually 3.3V or 5V (depending on your microcontroller).
Step 2: Hardware Connections
Pin Description:

VIN: Connect to 3.3V or 5V (check sensor compatibility).
GND: Connect to the ground pin of the microcontroller.
SDA: Connect to the SDA (data) pin of the microcontroller.
SCL: Connect to the SCL (clock) pin of the microcontroller.
